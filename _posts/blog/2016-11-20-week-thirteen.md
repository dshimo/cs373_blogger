### What did I do this past week?
For the class, this past week was all about completing the final phase for our project. I'm sort of glad that we overestimated a lot of our stories because a lot of free time opened up upon our completion. In addition to class work, Texas Deep Treble performed at Project Linking the Arts at the Hogg Auditorium Saturday.

### What's in my way?
Nothing's stopping me now! Just kidding. Finals are creeping in and it's not good.

### What will I do next week?
I'm going to begin reviewing everything I've learned this semester in preparation for finals and dare I say life. There's also a very good chance that I might end up doing nothing because it's also Thanksgiving break. This year I intend to fully participate in the cooking, so maybe I'll come back to school with some culinary knowledge.

## The Experience in the Classroom
As we approach the end of the semester, the momentum of the material is noticeably becoming slower. With the amount of material to quiz daily running dry, I have no clue if we will be having quizzes during Presentation days. 

## Tip of the Week
Remember to review for finals early; We've all been there before. The desire to take a break over Thanksgiving is definitely there, and by all means, take it. The problem lies in continuing to relax. An object in motion stays in motion and it's best to keep that driving chugging on. Once we've gone to a complete stop, it would take considerable effort to get back into the mood. For some, that kind of force is the pressure accumlated after continual procrastination, which by then, would often be too late. It definitely hope that I'll listen to my own words though...
