### What did I do this past week?
For me, I had an algo exam on the same day as our SWE exam. Since I felt like I followed the SWE lectures more closely, I put my priority to algorithms. Thank goodness our SWE exam was much later in the night which gave me enough time to cram! I definitely don't encourage this though.

### What's in my way?
As listed as the tip of the week later, my confidence in whether the code would behave as I expected was relatively low by not testing it out in Python. As we've learned throughout the lectures, if you don't know the rules that well, things can go whack!

### What will I do next week?
Now that the midterm has passed, it's time to start worrying about Project 3!

## The Experience in the Classroom
The class continued as normal despite a quickly approaching midterm in the week. Downing was open to questions, but we didn't really do any review over early material in class. I can agree with this decision as all material previously covered were posted online. We couldn't really afford to spend our hour on old stuff as we continued to learn new material up to the midterm! This really encourages people to study and review on their own time and I like this kind of independence-building. I feel like a broken record constantly appreciating Downing's teaching experience in the classroom, but he's just that good a professor. Getting called on by him isn't even a problem anymore; It encourages particiation and he tries make sure every student is following along.

## Tip of the Week
Suggested throughout the class was to simply play with Python outside of class. I didn't do too much of this and I'm certain after  I have taken the midterm that it would have benefited me a lot. I've been told his exams vary and our particular semester had exclusively all coding questions. Getting familiar enough with Python would have definitely boosted my fluidity and confidence in writing code without an interpreter or compiler. I suggest future students prepare themselves appropriately unlike I did!
