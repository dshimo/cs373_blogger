### What did I do this past week?
I was busy being SICK. Coughing my butt off, and often to 6am. Still, I've attended every class but went home almost immediately every time. I had to wear a face mask for a few days to hopefully calm the people around me. Because of my illness, I haven't been able to work that much wit my partner over Netflix. We did find something useful for remote pair programming, and I'll talk about down in the tip of the week.

### What's in my way?
Viruses, bacteria. When your personal health is not enough of an issue, you also have to worry about others because of how contagious sickness can be. Even in the better half of the week where my body is mostly recovered, I have to avoid people because of how much I cough. Because I haven't had the opportunity to look deeper into the project, I have to say that my biggest obstacle is even trying to work on it.

### What will I do next week?
This is the week the project is due. In addition to that, there's the career fair that I'm hoping to attend. I sure hope my illness gets resolved before then.


## The Experience in the Classroom
This week was a little special because Downing invited a guest to speak for us. A representative from Bloomberg came to talk about his experiences as well as talk about life's tips and tricks for computer science students. I did not expect the talk to occupy the whole lecture, but after listening to it, it seemed an hour might not have been enough time. This was a welcoming change of pace reminding me that there's more to life at the moment besides school. After school is over, I'll be in society and working on things that can have real world consequences. I must thank Downing again for this kind of experience. It also serves as another point to never skip a single class!

## Tip of the Week
The program me and my partner found to work for us is Screenhero. It allows screen sharing while giving remote users an additional mouse and the ability to type on the host's computer. There's smaller smart details, such as preventing the clicking of another window while the host is typing. Getting Screenhero was a bit of a hassle because they've closed sign-ups, but there are still work-arounds for the resourceful ones. If anyone needs an invitation from me, feel free to shoot me an email (dshi@utexas.edu). Screenhero is also integrated with Slack now, and Slack is a great place to communicate group work.
