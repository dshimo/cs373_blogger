### What did I do this past week?
I was busy being SICK. Coughing my butt off, and often to 6am. Still, I've attended every class but went home almost immediately every time. I had to wear a face mask for a few days to hopefully calm the people around me. Because of my illness, I haven't been able to work that much wit my partner over Netflix. We did find something useful for remote pair programming, and I'll talk about down in the tip of the week.

### What's in my way?
Viruses, bacteria. When your personal health is not enough of an issue, you also have to worry about others because of how contagious sickness can be. Even in the better half of the week where my body is mostly recovered, I have to avoid people because of how much I cough. Because I haven't had the opportunity to look deeper into the project, I have to say that my biggest obstacle is even trying to work on it.

### What will I do next week?
This is the week the project is due. In addition to that, there's the career fair that I'm hoping to attend. I sure hope my illness gets resolved before then.


## The Experience in the Classroom


## Tip of the Week
Do not skip class! It really goes without saying that you should not skip any college course you take, but Downing's teaching style has serious consequences for its skippers. You would miss the quizzes at the beginning of every class, sure, but you would also miss the dialogue that occurs in each class. All his texts are posted online, but the real treasure floats in the air, being the interaction and atmosphere of the class. It's like a live concert to a CD Album, plus some.
