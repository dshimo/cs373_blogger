### What did I do this past week?
The development for the IDB project was rather slow this week. We mostly sorted out our user stories and determined which specific tasks must be done. After all, the real drive to finish the project always comes during the week that it's due.
MLH Prime was this weekend as well. I attempted to build a dancing Jibo, but all sights crashed as I realized how much work must be done. The work load wasn't the main problem; I was working alone. That was rather disappointing, but if I can't persuade others to join me then it's partially my own fault.

### What's in my way?
If I intend to be (more) successful, I need to further develop my presentation skills. I've gotten very familiar with creating slides and such, but trying to sell and idea or expressing a vision can always be done better in my opinion. I'm not too sure if my friends declined to join my group because they already had their own projects to pursue (which seems the case), or they were simply rejecting me. Either way, because I found no others, the project was dead from the start. Well not necessarily dead, but it would never come to life within 24 hours.

### What will I do next week?
Next week, we do phase 3!

## The Experience in the Classroom
Ah...refactoring. I personally found this unit a little boring and was unfortunately blanking out often during class. We joked about why we were learning Java in Software Engineering. I still attended every class because it's still useful and I must continue to recommend students to participate in lectures. Every lecture is a great help and it's surprising to realize we have only a handful of lectures left this semester.

## Tip of the Week
If the theme of this week is about expressing one's ideas, then I suppose my tip would be to practice your elevator pitch every now and then. Even if you're not pursuing a job, introductions happen so often that you might as well have it memorized and trimmed up. I suppose I'm also going to start verbally reading news articles on my own every other morning.
