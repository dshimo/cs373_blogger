### What did I do this past week?
This week, attention was obviously put towards completing Project #4, or Phase 2 of our internet data base. Here's a [link] for the lazy.

### What's in my way?
This phase appeared much simpler for us and our group without a clear reason why. We believe our hard work from Phase 1 carried over, allowing us to simply add or build things on our website. Most of the work went into the front-end and I got exposed to more material which was nice.

### What will I do next week?
Objectives for next week aren't exactly clear at this point, but defautly it should simply be "Be Better than Yesterday."

## The Experience in the Classroom
I'll be honest and say that this week in the classroom was quite slow and dare I say boring. I'm sure the lecture for showing different queries on databases is effective using examples, but it also seemed simple enough for us to guess or review on our own time. Some of the code in class notes has unclear behavior, where Downing's advice benefits us greatly, but still a majority of it has "expected" behavior. 

## Tip of the Week
I'm not sure why no one told me about the wonders of tmux but I will make it my duty to spread the word. Any terminal user should learn [tmux] or [screen]; tmux is superior in my opinion. Short for terminal multiplexer, it essentially allows you to switch between several programs within one terminal window. Additionally, you can detach or attach sessions (which saves your layout with windows, panes, buffers, etc.). Another cool thing is if you multiple windows attach to the same session, both will see the update. Technically you can use this for pair programming then! You can split your window to vim and shell within one terminal window! I strongly encourage anyone who uses the terminal to try out this open-source software.
