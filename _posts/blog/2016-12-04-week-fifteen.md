### What did I do this past week?
This week wrapped up the class by finishing off the presentations for our IDB projects and our second and final exam. Therefore, this past week was all about getting that presentation to look pretty and to get good grades on the exam.

### What's in my way?
A couple of topics worried me before the exam: SQL Queries and Refactoring. I've done plenty of SQL, but they're usually done where testing is aloud so I can test my answers. Since I relied on this, I'm never too confident in submitting an answer for a SQL query on the fly. I also did read the refactoring textbook, but there's simply so much material that I only hope the question aligns with my limited knowledge coincidentally.

### What will I do next week?
I'm done with the semester! Time to relax and play video games!

## The Experience in the Classroom
So, dear reader, the experience in the classroom this week was exclusively presentations. Given that this project has gone through three iterations, there's bound to be some good in everyone's presentations. And it held true; Everyone gave interesting presentations and their websites looked great. I mentioned one week that I wanted to improve my speaking ability, and giving a presentation covered just that. Downing has a great coverage of skills that will benefit you in the industry field and can't appreciate it enough. 

## Tip of the Week
Kind of an obvious and restated tip, but I definitely think one should make an effort to continue to stay in touch with the group members one enjoyed working with. If there was good work done, the group, or some subset, could reform for future project. Additionally, connections are strong assets that no one should undervalue. There's always that possibility of going down a line of decisions where an opportunity will present itself not otherwise available.
