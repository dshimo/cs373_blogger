### What did I do this past week?
With project #3 officially posted, assembling a team and formulating a plan was our top priority for the week. The most time consuming part was coming up with an idea for the project.

### What's in my way?
It seems like Downing has had somewhat lackluster projects in the past so his requirements this semester were pretty strict. Our team, SWEdishfish, had difficulty coming up with a well connected database that wasn't entertainment and was also large enough to consist of four models. Thankfully we did jump over this hurdle eventually. Brilliance strikes during team lunches!

### What will I do next week?
I'll be attempting to put together our website of course. With the help of some friends of course.

## The Experience in the Classroom
The experience I want to talk about in today's blog is the importance of class participation and how important it is to have the people willing to ask questions. I understand the latter isn't really something you can control, but having a genuinely curious learning environment is real nice. Downing's lectures are good but there are bound to be some small pieces of information that aren't communicated. For the benefit of the class we have an observant or courageous student to help clarify the info. It's also great to have an active Piazza.

I know this was a highly individualized blog entry, but I never truly respected our class until this week (with the introduction of decorators and project #3).

## Tip of the Week
When managing and communicating amongst the team, Slack has become one of the best free tools out there. From adding members to adding app integrations, it's all pretty simple and can be really rewarding.
