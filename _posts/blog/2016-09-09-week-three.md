### What did I do this past week?
Turning in and completing the first assignment, collatz. The programming for it wasn't too difficult. The real stress lies in preparing the files to turn in. Note to self: Do it way ahead of time!

### What's in my way?
This was simple inexperience. There were many firsts, but preparing to turn in projects should definitely be easier now. It's likely that from now on the real stress will be building the projects.

### What will I do next week?
Fill me

## The Experience in the Classroom
Learning syntax for python.

## Tip of the Week
If you have the time to mess around with your work environment, go checkout xmonad
