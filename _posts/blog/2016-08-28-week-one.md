### What did I do this past week?
Since it's the fist week of school, I mostly looked at my class syllabi and looked at where I can adjust my schedule. I also read up on preparing Docker on my personal computer.

### What's in my way?
I would say my inexperience and lack of exposure to certain software has been the largest obstacle this week. I'm slogging my way through setting this blog up as we speak!

### What will I do next week?
I intend to setup Docker and read up on the other software we'll be using this semester. Downing has stressed the importance of self-improvement and motivating oneself to be proactive.
