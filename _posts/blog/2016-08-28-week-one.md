###What did I do this past week?
Since it's the fist week of school, I mostly looked at my class syllabi and looked at where I can adjust my schedule. I also read up on preparing Docker on my personal computer.
###What's in my way?
I would say my inexperience and lack of exposure to certain software has been the largest obstacle this week. I'm slogging my way through setting this blog up as we speak!
###What will I do next week?
I intend to setup Docker and read up on the other software we'll be using this semester. Downing has stressed the importance of being proactive. It gives us the impression that most of the learning and training will occur outside the classroom. The curriculum is more of a guide providing vague directions which we must later traverse with our own two feet.

##The Experience in the Classroom

##Tip of the Week
Recently I found a lovely subreddit called /r/programming. For those unfamiliar with reddit, consider it the "front-page of the Internet" where subreddits are smaller categories/communities dedicated to a topic. Here, /r/programming focuses on news and discusses computer programming. A good read I found recently described why [GNU Grep is so fast]. From there, I read about the Boyer-Moore algorithm, and then further into more string-matching algorithms!
